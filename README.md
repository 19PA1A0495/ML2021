# Boomer the Bot
Boomer is a chatbot created to know the needs of students especially about the courses they want to acquire after their Secondary education. It performs 4 main operations like
	  1.	Suggest the course
	  2.	Find their age
	  3.	Crack a joke
	  4.	End the chat
So, to suggest a course, the bot needs some requirements like 10th and 12th pass grades and then the stream they want to opt.   
The other operation calculates the age when the user has to mention birth date, month and year.  
It cracks a joke when the user asks to do that operation  
The bot exits when 4th operation is asked.
